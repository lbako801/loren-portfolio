The Loren Portfolio's design draws inspiration from a computer terminal, incorporating a monochromatic color scheme with green and gray text to mimic screen pixels. The transparent image background further adds to the illusion of a digital environment. The interface is sleek and minimalist, emphasizing ease of use.
